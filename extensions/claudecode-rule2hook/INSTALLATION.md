## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

In Claude Code, type one of these:

```bash
# If installed project-specific
/project:rule2hook "Format Python files with black after editing"

# If installed globally  
/rule2hook "Format Python files with black after editing"
```

### Common Rules You Can Use

```bash
# Code Formatting
/project:rule2hook "Format Python files with black after editing"
/project:rule2hook "Run prettier on JavaScript files after saving"
/project:rule2hook "Format code with eslint --fix before committing"

# Git Workflow
/project:rule2hook "Run git status when finishing a task"
/project:rule2hook "Check for TODO comments before committing"
/project:rule2hook "Run git diff before confirming commits"

# Testing
/project:rule2hook "Run pytest when modifying test files"
/project:rule2hook "Execute npm test after changing source files"
/project:rule2hook "Run unit tests before pushing to remote"

# Security
/project:rule2hook "Scan for API keys before saving configuration files"
/project:rule2hook "Check for hardcoded passwords before committing"

# Complex Commands
/project:rule2hook "Run 'npm run lint && npm test' after editing source files"
```

### Using CLAUDE.md for Rules

1. Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project with rules:
```markdown
# Project Rules

- Format Python files with black after editing
- Run tests before committing  
- Check for TODO comments before pushing
```

2. Convert all rules at once:
```bash
/project:rule2hook  # Reads and converts all rules from CLAUDE.md
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Quick Test
```bash
# Run the interactive test script
cd claude-code-ultimate/extensions/claudecode-rule2hook
./quick-test.sh
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Create a test rule:**
```bash
/project:rule2hook "Format Python files with black after editing"
```

2. **Check the generated hooks:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/hooks.json
```

3. **Validate the hooks:**
```bash
python3 validate-hooks.py
```

## üìÅ File Structure

After installation, your structure should look like:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rule2hook.md     # The slash command
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                # Optional: your project rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/.claude/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks.json          # Generated hooks configuration
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Rules at Once
```bash
/project:rule2hook "Format Python files after editing, Run tests before committing, Check for TODOs"
```

### Custom Commands with Quotes
```bash
/project:rule2hook "Run 'black . && flake8 && pytest' before committing Python code"
```

### Conditional Rules
```bash
/project:rule2hook "Format only if file extension is .py or .js"
/project:rule2hook "Run tests only if changes affect src/ directory"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
- **Problem**: `/project:rule2hook` shows "command not found"
- **Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct directory and the file exists at `.claude/commands/rule2hook.md`

### Hooks Not Working
- **Problem**: Generated hooks don't execute
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check `~/.claude/hooks.json` exists and is valid JSON
  2. Run `python3 validate-hooks.py` to check configuration
  3. Ensure commands are executable in your shell

### Rule Not Understood  
- **Problem**: Claude doesn't generate the expected hook
- **Solution**:
  1. Be more specific with timing words ("after editing", "before committing")
  2. Specify exact commands in quotes: `"Run 'black .' after editing"`
  3. Use tool names Claude recognizes: "Edit", "Write", "Bash"

## üìã Rule Pattern Guide

| Pattern | Example | Generated Hook Type |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| "X after editing" | "Format Python after editing" | PostToolUse |
| "X before saving" | "Check syntax before saving" | PreToolUse |  
| "X when finishing" | "Run git status when finishing" | Stop |
| "X before committing" | "Run tests before committing" | PreToolUse (Bash) |

## üîÑ Updating

To get the latest version:
```bash
cd claude-code-ultimate
git pull origin main
# Re-copy the command file if needed
cp extensions/claudecode-rule2hook/commands/rule2hook.md ~/.claude/commands/
```
