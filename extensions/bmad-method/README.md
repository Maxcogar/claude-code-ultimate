## Overview

**BMad Method's Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Agentic Planning:** Dedicated agents (Analyst, PM, Architect) collaborate with you to create detailed, consistent PRDs and Architecture documents. Through advanced prompt engineering and human-in-the-loop refinement, these planning agents produce comprehensive specifications that go far beyond generic AI task generation.

**2. Context-Engineered Development:** The Scrum Master agent then transforms these detailed plans into hyper-detailed development stories that contain everything the Dev agent needs - full context, implementation details, and architectural guidance embedded directly in story files.

This two-phase approach eliminates both **planning inconsistency** and **context loss** - the biggest problems in AI-assisted development. Your Dev agent opens a story file with complete understanding of what to build, how to build it, and why.

## Quick Start

### One Command for Everything (IDE Installation)

**Just run one of these commands:**

```bash
npx bmad-method install
# OR if you already have BMad installed:
git pull
npm run install:bmad
```

This single command handles:

- **New installations** - Sets up BMad in your project
- **Upgrades** - Updates existing installations automatically
- **Expansion packs** - Installs any expansion packs you've added to package.json

> **That's it!** Whether you're installing for the first time, upgrading, or adding expansion packs - these commands do everything.

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ required

### Fastest Start: Web UI Full Stack Team at your disposal (2 minutes)

1. **Get the bundle**: Save or clone the [full stack team file](dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt) or choose another team
2. **Create AI agent**: Create a new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
3. **Upload & configure**: Upload the file and set instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. **Start Ideating and Planning**: Start chatting! Type `*help` to see available commands or pick an agent like `*analyst` to start right in on creating a brief.
5. **CRITICAL**: Talk to BMad Orchestrator in the web at ANY TIME (#bmad-orchestrator command) and ask it questions about how this all works!
6. **When to move to the IDE**: Once you have your PRD, Architecture, optional UX and Briefs - its time to switch over to the IDE to shard your docs, and start implementing the actual code!

## üåü Beyond Software Development - Expansion Packs

BMad's natural language framework works in ANY domain. Expansion packs provide specialized AI agents for creative writing, business strategy, health & wellness, education, and more. Also expansion packs can expand the core BMad-Method with specific functionality that is not generic for all cases.
