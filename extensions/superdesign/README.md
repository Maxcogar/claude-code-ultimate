SuperDesign is the first **open-source design agent** that lives right inside your IDE.  
Generate UI mockups, components, and wireframes directly from natural language prompts.  
Works seamlessly with Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and plain VS Code.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ **Product Mock**: Instantly generate full UI screens from a single prompt
- 🧩 **UI Components**: Create reusable components you can drop into your code
- 📝 **Wireframes**: Explore low-fidelity layouts for fast iteration
- 🔁 **Fork & Iterate**: Duplicate and evolve designs easily
- 📥 **Prompt-to-IDE**: Copy prompts into your favorite AI IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Install the Extension** from the Cursor/VS Code Marketplace
2. Open the `SuperDesign` sidebar panel
3. Type a prompt (e.g., _"Design a modern login screen"_)
4. View generated mockups, components, and wireframes
5. Fork, tweak, and paste into your project

## ❓ FAQ

**Is it free and open source?**  
Yes! We are open source — fork it, extend it, remix it.

Yes — use your own prompt templates, modify behaviors, or add commands.

**Can SuperDesign update existing UI?**  
Absolutely — select a component, describe the change, and let the agent do the rest.
